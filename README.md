# Tech Demo
 Programming Tech Demo - Due 04.03.22
## Introduction
I am creating a game to show of my programming skills. In addition, I will learn how to use and create animations.
I will create all of the models and animations myself and use minimal videos to make the code original.
## Game Idea
As taken from the GDD:
I like the idea of the vr game GORN. It is a gladiator wave game and I enjoy these types of games. 
I want to make a endless game which will only end when you die. I wante a range of medieval weapons to stick to the theme
